#Fight Goblins, Eat Pizza!

The object of the game is to rend the flesh and still the heart of the green menace.

The secondary objective is to live a long life of virtue by consuming as much Pizza as possible.

#Development

This a procedurally generated roguelike created by an amateur programmer.

It is an attempt to understand the basics of creating dynamically generated content in my preferred medium.

In the initial (and present) version, it was largely table-based with the traditional roguelike grid represented by table cells. Times have changed on the Internet, though.

#Future Plans

Here are some of my future ideas pulled from my top-secret game design document.

- dynamically populated goblin housing
- an origin for the Pizza, some kind of Goblin Pizza Hut
- an options screen with traditional roguelike options (verbosity, fruit name, etc.)
- a CANVAS-based graphics tileset option because sprite animation on the web seems cool
